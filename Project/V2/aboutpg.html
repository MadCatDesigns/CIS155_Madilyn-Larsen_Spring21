    </header>

    <p>
        My name is Madilyn Larsen and I am an Artist and beginner photographer. I have been drawing my whole life and picked 
        up photography about two years ago. Types of art pieces I draw are mainly animals, characters, white & black, and some calligraphy. 
        As for my art style I would say it is fun and simple, but I have recently been drawing black and white candid pieces with 
        graphite and charcoal. I am currently going to Olympic College for my Associates degree in digital media and am hoping to go 
        into visual communications for my Bachelors to become a graphic designer. This website is for one of my digital media classes 
        called web development as a project. Over the course this website took me three months to build, hope you like it!
