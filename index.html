<p>Welcome to my art portfolio website! In this website you can browse through my artwork, look at the materials I used, 
   and a little bit <a href="aboutpg.html#about">about</a> me in the pages above. I originally created this website for a computer information system class I took at 
   Olympic College in the spring of 2021, but I wanted this website to be useful to me after the class which is why I created a 
   protfolio website. I will occasionally update my website with finished artworks and ones I am currently working on, you can see works
   in progress in the New page above in the navigation bar. Hope you like my work!
